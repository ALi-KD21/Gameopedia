                Minecraft is a sandbox video game that uses blocks to represent 
                the world and its components; you can think of it a lot like virtual Legos. 
                It was created in 2009 by the programmer Notch from the Mojang company. Since then, 
                it has sold over 200 million copies and by 2020 has over 126 million monthly active users.
                Players can explore the world and build or destroy because every block is 
                breakable. Buildings and other structures are made by placing blocks on top of or next to each other. 
                From these materials, you can create wondrous structures and functional machinery.

                Rocket League is a fantastical sport-based video game, developed 
                by Psyonix (it’s “soccer with cars”). It
                features a competitive game mode based on teamwork and outmaneuvering opponents.
                Players work with their team to advance the ball down the field, and 
                score goals in their opponents’ net.
                Rocket League is a technical game which involves both high-level
                dexterity and fast-paced gameplay.
                While one of the most welcoming elements of the game is 
                its accessibility and familiarity with
                traditional sport (soccer), the best players are
                highly advanced and have fine-tuned their mechanics.
